        >“It’s what non-car people don’t get. They see all cars as just a ton
        and a half, two tons of wires, glass, metal, and rubber, and that’s all
        they see. People like you or I know we have an unshakable belief that
        cars are living entities… You can develop a relationship with a car and
        that’s what non-car people don’t get… When something has foibles and
        won’t handle properly, that gives it a particularly human quality
        because it makes mistakes, and that’s how you can build a relationship
        with a car that other people won’t get.”
